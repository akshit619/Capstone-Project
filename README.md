# Stock Market Prediction Using LSTM Neural Networks

Stock markets exhibit highly non-linear behavior, making investment decisions challenging for traders. To address this, our project leverages **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** neural networks to forecast stock market trends with improved accuracy.

We specifically focus on predicting daily stock movements for two major **NSE indices: NIFTY 50 and NIFTY BANK**. Our approach involves developing **single-layer and multi-layer LSTM models**, which are evaluated using performance metrics such as **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**.

To enhance model performance and prevent overfitting, we incorporate **regularization techniques** like **dropout** and **early stopping**. Comparative analysis suggests that **LSTM-based models outperform traditional machine learning models**, such as decision trees and random forests, in stock market prediction.

This project highlights the effectiveness of deep learning in analyzing sequential financial data and demonstrates how LSTM networks can capture long-term dependencies to improve forecasting accuracy.
